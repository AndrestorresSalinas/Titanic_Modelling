# Titanic_Modelling
In this repository, I used the Titanic dataset to build predictive models for determining whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic. The dataset originates from Kaggle's Titanic competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), and it has been widely used in data science for binary classification tasks.
